    "Well, zapping powers are cool. And probably really useful because dang, you don't know what kind of early warning system he has, but whatever predators it's meant to keep away, all he'd have to do is shout at them."
    "You look around. You're on a nearby hill about a hundred yards away from the boy's hive. From the outside it's large and leaning with square windows and an unnecessary number of balconies, although who are you to say what's necessary? Maybe this dude really likes balconies. He could probably use the fresh air."
    "A couple of similarly large and lopsided hives scatter the skyline. Hmm. Hives. You aren't sure what made you think of calling them that, but it feels right. Maybe because of the organic, insectile architecture, like they were grown instead of built."
    "You clearly aren't on Earth anymore. The sky is black and the bushes are purple, and there are two moons. Neither of them is your grey moon, though."
    "You think maybe you should be freaked out by this strange alien land, but it's just too surreal to fully believe. Besides, you kind of like it here. It's comfortable. This is a pretty good hill."

    "He's gesturing for you to come on, so you walk down the hill. The heat from the rising sun washes over your back, and you speed up. That sun is bad news, you just know it."
    "Light bleeds further across the horizon, and your pace gets a little leisurely."
    "The troll boy crosses his arms. His shoulders are rounded in a slouch, like he spends a lot of time making himself smaller. His black claws are bitten down. You wave an awkward hello."

    k "\"ZAPPY\" POWERS? WOW, VERY NORMAL."
    "Well, today's not really a day for normal, is it? But hey, now that you've thought of it, maybe those happy powers are the key to getting back home! What if you teleported there?"
    "Home is rather far away, though. You don't fancy being lost in the middle of space. A little practice might be called for first."
